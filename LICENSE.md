**"THE COFFEEWARE LICENSE" (Revision 2):**

<[@alanwalter45][1]> wrote this code. As long as you retain this notice you
can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think 
this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a coffee in return. 

Also, you might consider following me on [discord][2] for any comments and/or 
questions you might have and if you'd like you can send me a donation 
at any time to support my work, ask me how!
